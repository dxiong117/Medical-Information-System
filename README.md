# Medical-Information-System
The medical information system has three layers. The Domain layer has three domains as billing, domain, and research. These are included in the module ClinicDomian. This layer interacts directly with persistent architecture (PostgreSql database) using JPA and performs the business logic including patient operations, provider operations, and treatment operations. In the Service layer, each domain has a service module including ClinicBillingService, ClinicService, and ClinicResearchService which acts as an intermediate for receiving client-side service requests and sending them to the domain layer to perform actual business logic. In the Resource layer, there is a REST API for web service request access.
The abstraction between these layers includes DAO and MOM: DAO (Data Access Object) implementation for service to access domain objects; MOM (Message-Oriented-Middleware) using JMS for client-service, and service-service message transfer.
